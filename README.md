# Squuid

Squuid (incomplete) is a hardware abstraction layer for I/O (sensors and actuators) and communication (UART, Parallel, 1-wire). 
My aim for squuid is to make it a one-stop shop for my embedded systems projects by supporting a wide range of sensors and actuators,
and providing peripheral communication. The definitions for each microcontroller, register addresses, and register mask values will be 
saved in an EEPROM using Squuidâ€™s memory map.
